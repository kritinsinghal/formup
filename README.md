The application uses the PoseNet model that is coded in TensorFlow and detects the angle between the key body joints. For example, it uses the angle between the hands and the shoulders while performing a push-up. Using studies and data on proper training forms, we've coded our algorithm to include the correct range of angles for different set of exercises.
